# Optimal Merge Pattern

Let $f\scriptsize 1$, $f\scriptsize 2$, $f\scriptsize 3$ are three files whose record
length are 20, 10, 30 respectfully. This files are arranged in factorial $3 = 6$ ways but marging can
be done in factorial $\dfrac{3}{2} = \dfrac{6}{2} = 3$ ways.

## Problem Objective

Objective of optimal merge pattern is, if there are $n$ files then this files
can be arranged in factorial $n$ ways ( *Under the general permutation concept* )
but under the optimal merge pattern concept this files can be merged in factorial $\dfrac{n}{2}$ ways.
