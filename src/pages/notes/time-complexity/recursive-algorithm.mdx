# Recursive Algorithm -
  - By Recursive Tree 
  - By Recursive Equation


### Recursive Tree
  - It is a tree which is used to represent the recursive function calls.
    - It is used to identify the time complexity of recursive algorithm.

    <br/>

  - Solved with help of 
    - **Time Complexity :-** no. of (#f) of function call present in algorithm.
    - **Space Complexity :-** Identfy the depth of recursive tree. or maximum no. of activation records available during time.

### Recursive Equation
  - It is a tree which is used to represent the recursive function calls.
  - It is used to identify the time complexity of recursive algorithm.

  <br/>

  - Solved by Master's theorm
  - Solved by Recurance Equation (Substitiution Method)
    - Substitiution Method is used to solve the recurance equation by assuming the time complexity of the function and then proving it by induction.
    - Learn in discreate start the run time of the algorithm.

### Problem 
Find the time complexity of the following algorithm.

<CodeS>
```c
int fact (int n){
    if (n == 0 || n == 1)  // The condition is called Base condition
        return 1;
    else
        return n * fact(n-1);  // Recursive or Inductive condition
}
```
</CodeS>

$ n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*3*2*1$

0! = 1

1! = 1

// Diagram

- Total 5 function calls $( F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5)$ for  n = 5
- For  n = n = total #f function calls = n

So the time complexity of the above algorithm is $O(n)$
