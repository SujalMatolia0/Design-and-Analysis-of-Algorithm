**Design and analysis of algorithms**

Design and Analysis of Algorithms is a fundamental aspect of computer science that involves creating efficient solutions to computational problems and evaluating their performance. DSA focuses on designing algorithms that effectively address specific challenges and analyzing their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.

## Algorithms

<u>Finite set</u> ( *It is a countable set* ) of steps ( *Fundamental Instructions* ) to solve a problem in step by step manner.

<Cola title="Fundamental Instructions">

Are the basic instructions that are used to write an algorithm.

**Example**

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==` etc.

In CPU only Arithmetic and Logical operations are performed.

<CodeS>
```py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
</CodeS>

Heart of Computer is **CPU** ( *Central Processing Unit* ).

Heart of CPU is **ALU** ( *Arithmetic and Logical Unit* ).

Heart of Prorceesor is **ALU**.
