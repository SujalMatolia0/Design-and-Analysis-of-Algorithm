# Characteristics of Fundamental Instructions

## Definiteness

Every fundamental instruction must be define
without any ambiguity ( *no confusion* ).

**Example**

Shows Ambiguity

<CodeS>
```py
c = 2 t 2
```
</CodeS>

Shows Unambiguity

<CodeS>
```py
c = 2 + 2
```
</CodeS>

## Finiteness

Every fundamental instruction must be terminated
with a finite amount of time.

**Example**

<CodeS>
```py
# Infinite loop
x = 2
while x > 1:
    x = x + 1 # This instruction will never terminate
```
</CodeS>


## Input âœ°

Every fundamental instruction accepts at least 0  as ( *atleast it take 1 input like wise 0* ) a input and provides at least 1 output.
