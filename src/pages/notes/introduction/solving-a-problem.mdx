# Steps for solving a problem

## Identify the problem

**Example**

Arrange four Queens ( *Q1* , *Q2* , *Q3* , *Q4* ) on a 4x4 chess board.

<ChessBoard data={[
    ["", "Q-B1", "", "Q-D1"],
    ["Q-A2", "Q-B2", "Q-C2", ""],
    ["Q-A3", "Q", "Q-C3", "Q-D3"],
    ["Q-A4", "Q-B4", "Q-C4", ""]
]} />

## Identify the Conditions

**Example**

1. No two queens can be in the same row.
2. No two queens can be in the same column.
3. No two queens can be in the same diagonal.

## Logic Building

Dependents on the characteristics of the problems
we can select or chose anyone of the following
design strategies ( *Method to develop or design the logic* ).

1. **Divide and Conquer**
2. **Greedy Method**
3. **Dynamic Programming**
4. **Backtracking** ( *Expresive power is more as compared to other* )
5. **Branch and Bound**

## Validation

It is done by mathematician who developed this algorithm or similar algorithm.

Most of the algorithms are validated by using **Mathematical Induction Theorm**.

for $n = 4$ $TRUE$

assume $n = k$ $TRUE$ ( *$k$ is a assumption* )

if you can make $n = k + 1$ $TRUE$

$∀ \ n ∈ N$ ( *for all natural numbers* )

## Analysis

The process of comparing two algorithms <u>rate of growth</u> with respect to

1. **Time Complexity ✰**
2. **Space Complexity**
3. **Network Bandwidth**
4. **Minimum Number of Registers** etc.

is called **Analysis of Algorithm**.

### Comparision

1. **Priari Analysis ✰✰** ( *Before Implementation* )
2. **Posteriori Analysis** ( *After Implementation* )

        It depends on the Principle called **Frequency Counting of Fundamental Instructions** ( *Number of ALU visits* )

        <br/>

        It Means that system independent analysis

        <br/>

        **Example**

        $x = x + 1$ ( *FIX* )

        <br/>

        Time Complexity

        = $Constant$

        = $O(1)$

        = $Θ(1)$

        It Means that system dependent analysis

        <br/>

        **Example**

        $x = x + 1$

        <br/>

        Time Complexity

        = $0.2 \ ns$ for $M/C 1$

        = $0.3 \ ns$ for $M/C 2$

        = $0.4 \ ns$ for $M/C 3$

## Implementation

Publish your algorithm in journals, books, websites etc.

## Testing and Debugging

It is done by Programmer who works on your algorithm in real time environment like `c`, `c++`, `java`, `python` etc.

## Maintenance

It is implemented by Operation and Maintenance department in real market.
